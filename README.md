## Business Case

DataTonic provides junior executives with an extremely effective solution for basic and time-consuming data processing, document creation or business intelligence tasks.

### Enterprise Autonomation Agent

Do not wait for accounting, legal or business intelligence reporting with uncertain quality and long review cycles. DataTonic accelerates the slowest part of analysis : data processing and project planning execution. 

# How it works :

this section explains how Data Tonic works to produce what you need, consistently.

- your request is first processed according to a statement of work
- additional data is retrieved and stored
- multiple agents are created based on your specific use case

# Technology : 

this section describes how it works from a technical perspective:

- Autogen uses a semantic-kernel function calling agent to access the internet using the google api semantic-kernel then processes the new information and stores it inside a SQL database orchestrated by Taskweaver.
- Gemini is used in various configurations both for text using the autogen connector and for multimodal/image information processing.

```json
        "api_key": "your OpenAI Key goes here",
```
and 
```json
        "api_key": "your Google's GenAI Key goes here",
```

#### Configure OpenAI Key(s)
    1. modify Line 135 in autogen_module.py
        ```python
        os.environ['OPENAI_API_KEY'] = 'Your key here'
        ```
    2. modify .env.example

```python
line 64:    semantic_kernel_data_module = SemanticKernelDataModule('<google_api_key>', '<google_search_engine_id>')
```
and 
```python
line 158:    semantic_kernel_data_module = SemanticKernelDataModule('<google_api_key>', '<google_search_engine_id>')
