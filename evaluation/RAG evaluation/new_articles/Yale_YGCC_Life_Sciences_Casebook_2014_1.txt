Introduction
 Welcome to the 2014 Yale Graduate Consulting Club (YGCC) Life Sciences Casebook!
 This casebook was created with the intention of providing new practice cases based on the interview experiences
 of recent YGCC members, and providing a look at real-world problems that healthcare and life sciences
 consulting firms are currently helping to solve. There is also a selection of cases from other casebooks that can
 be explored to delve deeper into the healthcare and life sciences industries. My hope is that readers unfamiliar
 with this area can better navigate their understanding of this important business sector and can better orient
 themselves in their exploration of relevant business problems.

 Follow these general steps when practicing a case:

 1.   Pair up with a partner. Assign one person as the interviewer and the other as the candidate
 2.   Interviewer – take about 5 minutes to read through the case in your head. Then read the prompt to the
      candidate
 3.   Candidate – Note on paper important details from the prompt. Ask clarifying questions, then ask the
      interviewer if you can take about 1 minute to draw up a structured problem-solving approach. Then talk
      through your structure with the interviewer and ask for any additional information you think might be helpful
 4.   Interviewer – Listen carefully to candidate’s structure and logic. Are there any crucial pieces he/she is
      missing? Is he/she going down the right track? If not, try to lead the candidate in the right direction. Provide
      additional information only when the candidate asks for them. Then go through the questions one by one,
      providing the exhibits as appropriate
 5.   Candidate – Take as much initiative as you can in answering the questions. Calculate whatever you think is
      relevant
 6.   At the end of the case, the interviewer should ask the candidate to summarize (“synthesize”) the case. The
      candidate should give a very brief ~1 minute summary of his/her recommendations

 For the interviewer, we have included a glossary of healthcare and life science-specific terms in the appendix.

Disclaimer

 As the YGCC have limited experience and knowledge in the life sciences / healthcare fields, the definitions in the
 glossary and in the cases should not be taken as fact. This represents a stepping stone towards expanding your
 knowledge about this field should you wish to learn more.

 The science, treatments, and drugs portrayed in this casebook also should not be taken as accurate medical
 advice.

 While these cases are based on recent cases that candidates received during interviews, they have been
 modified and expanded from their original versions.

 What factors should be considered?
 Sample Issue Tree

 An example of a structure that can be used to approach this case. There are many variations on
 structures that could apply to a given case so do not be surprised if the candidate’s structure differ
 from the example structure. A good structure should be MECE and logical. Also remember there are
 always more than just one structure to solve the problem.

Prompt
Our client is CS Med, a medical device start-up company. CS Med built a new biopsy needle
attachment, AccuBiop, which is integrated directly into needles. This device exploits differences within
breast cancer masses for greater accuracy to decrease the need for a second biospy. AccuBiop is
approaching FDA approval so the CEO has brought our firm on board to explore routes to
commercialization.
Additional Information (provided on request)
Client Goals
- CEO wants to achieve $1M in profit as soon as possible to recoup R/D costs, but does not want to
   sell the patent for AccuBiop or the company
CS Med’s Capabilities
- CS Med mainly invested in R/D for the AccuBiops.
- AccuBiop would be the first revenue stream for the company
- The company does not yet have the manufacturing infrastructure make needles, or the experience
   to sell/market/distribute a product
Biopsy Needles
- Currently sold around $200 per needle and are disposed after one use
- Estimated market size is 200k biopsies/year.

Case 1: CS Med (Medical Device)
 Market Analysis
 When asked about the market size, provide 200k biopsies/year.
 If candidate request information about market trend and the potential market share for client
 (related to current competition) Present Exhibit 1
 What can be interpreted from this table?

 Interpretations of Exhibit 1
 1) Total sales = market size (as given above). Market is saturated
 2) Costs are not particularly different between the companies on the market
 3) C1 and C2 are offering a lower price. Could have larger market share by competing on price

 How could CS Med enter this saturated market?
 Product differentiation
  -Price
  -Features
  -Quality

 A good candidate should recognize AccuBiop adds new features and would proactively ask if the
 features fulfill unmet customer preferences
 How would you analyze if the features AccuBiop adds are relevant?
 - Physician surveys for features
 - Interview experts in the field

Yale Graduate Student Consulting Club© !                                                         13
Case 1: CS Med (Medical Device)
 Product Differentiation
 Provide Exhibit 2
 Interpretations of Exhibit 2
 1) Accuracy is the most important feature for the surveyed physicians so the AccuBiop adds
     relevant value
 2) Physicians specifically value this at $100 extra per needle

 Now that candidate realizes that AccuBiop can add relevant value, move to commercialization.

 Commercialization
 Candidate should have already thought of a few examples of commercialization styles, but if not
 utilize this time to brainstorm potential ways to market.
 - In house " Produce AccuBiop + needles alone
 - Partnership " Work with another company to produce needles with AccuBiop
 - Licensing " A subtype of partnership where the intellectual property of making needles with
     Accubiop are rented to another company to produce the needles with AccuBiop
 - Selling IP/Company (not an option from prompt)

 Interviewer should ask the candidate to evaluate in house commercialization first

Case 1: CS Med (Medical Device)
 In House Assessment
 To in house manufacture needles with AccuBiop, CS Med can make a maximum $10M
 investment in manufacturing, storage/inventory, sales/marketing, and distribution. By year 2
 this allows for the production and estimated sales of 10k needles with AccuBiops per year.

 What other information is needed to calculate profitability for this approach?
 Revenue Side
 -Expected units sold – 10k needles
 -Expected price - $300 per needle (max doctors will pay via Exhibit 2)
 Cost Side
 -Expected fixed cost - $10M investment
 -Expected variable cost - $30 for needle and $20 for AccuBiop (candidate should ask for)

 Profit
 Revenue:
 (10k needles) ($300/needle) = $3M per year
 Cost:
 Investment: $10M
 Variable Cost: (10K needles) ($30/needle + $20/AccuBiop) = $500K per year

 Year 1 Profit = ($10M), Accumulated Y2 Profit = ($7.5M)
 Gain $2.5M/year. Will breakeven year 5 and reach the goal of $1M profit by year 6

Case 1: CS Med (Medical Device)
 Partnership Assessment
 During this analysis, Company 3 has approached CS Med for a partnership. As the 3rd
 largest player in the market, Company 3 is looking for ways to improve market share by
 diversifying its product. For producing the needle with AccuBiop, CS Med would receive a
 royalty per needle, but will have to pay for and manufacture each AccuBiop

 How much can CS Med charge per AccuBiop to reach its $1M goal in profit in Year 1?
 Assumptions: All other costs (represented by cost/needle in the in house approach) will be
 covered by Company 3

 Calculation
 Example Company 3 Partnership - assume all needles are converted to needles with AccuBiop
 (Goal) < (C3 partnership revenue for AccuBiop) – (C3 partnership costs)
 (Goal) < (C3 needles sold) (price per AccuBiop) – (C3 needles sold) (cost per AccuBiop)

 $1M < (40k needles) ($x per AccuBiop) – (40k needles) ($20 per AccuBiop)
 $1M< 40k ($x-$20)
 ~$25/needle with AccuBiop < $x – $20
 ~$45/needle with AccuBiop = $x

 In this case, $45 per AccuBiop will lead to the profit goal within one year. Given the survey from
 Exhibit 2, physicians are willing to pay as much as $120 more for better quality, $45 should be
 easily acceptable.
Yale Graduate Student Consulting Club© !                                                              16
Case 1: CS Med (Medical Device)
 Summary / End of Case
 The CEO of CS Med would now like to hear a summation of your findings and a
 recommendation of which way to commercialize the AccuBiop

 Recommendation / Rationale
 CS Med should form a partnership with Company 3 to bring the AccuBiop to market. Within the first
 year, CS Med can reach the $1M profit goal by working with the 3rd player in the market and
 charging $45 per AccuBiop. In house manufacturing would be the slower approach, also requires a
 substantial financial burden on the company ($10M) that a start-up like CS Med may not want to
 incur.

 Risks
 Regulatory Approval AccuBiop still needs to complete regulatory assessment before
 commercialization and should be aware of this risk

 Competitive response of other players If the other companies could produce a similar needle
 improvement, this would lower the value of our product and could hurt the market share of our
 partner.

 Adoption Rate If AccuBiop needles are not adopted quickly enough, competitors would have more
 time to develop a similar product and to enter the market.


Yale Graduate Student Consulting Club© !                                                         17
Case 1: CS Med (Medical Device)
 Next Steps
 Negotiate Deal Terms A good candidate would note that the terms of the partnership were dictated
 by Company 3. The high value of the device to physicians should allow CS Med the leverage to
 negotiate better terms or partner with other companies. Terms could include a higher price per
 AccuBiop or an upfront payment.

 Increase manufacturing of AccuBiop needles By fulfilling the physicians’ need for accuracy, CS
 Med’s partner has the potential to increase market share. CS Med should prepare to increase
 production of AccuBiops to meet the demand beyond a given partner’s market share.

 Evaluate Other Partnerships An insightful candidate might suggest partnering with two or all three
 companies because this would maximize the “#needles sold by partner”. However, the firm would
 have to perform an analysis to see if working with multiple partners would be more profitable than
 an exclusive partnership.

Prompt
Global Pharmaceutical (GP) researches, manufactures, and sells medical products throughout the
world. GP is seeking new products to compliment its existing vaccine division. GP approached the
small biotech, Ear-X, to license its ear infection vaccine (EX1), which is currently at the end of clinical
trials. Ear-X is mainly a R/D company and thus has no manufacturing or distribution capabilities. The
current negotiated deal structure is $200M upfront and $15 per vaccine in royalties to Ear-X. GP has
hired our firm to analyze if this deal is acceptable.
Additional Information (provided on request)
Client Goals
- GP wants to breakeven on the $200M payment within a year after launching in the US market
Ear Infections (make sure the candidate understands this portion)
- Common in children 4 years old and younger
- Poor hygiene and high child-to-child contact are the main risk factors for spreading the infection
- Normally a self-resolving (goes away without treatment) condition but the infection is painful to the
   child
EX1
- EX1 will be an elective (non-mandatory) vaccine. Parents must ask for the vaccine or physicians
   suggest vaccination. Must be administered by a medical professional

Case 2: EarX (Ear Infection Vaccine)
 Market Analysis
 Since EX1 would be the first type of treatment for ear infections, there are no competitors or
 detailed customer information. How would you begin to determine if there is a market for
 this vaccine?

 -   Survey of pediatricians or experts in the field
 -   Survey of parent satisfaction with current care

 Surveys
 Four surveys of pediatricians have already been performed by our client (Exhibit 1).

 Interpretations of Exhibit 1
 • The four surveys do not come to a consensus on value of the vaccine
 • There are positive correlations with a higher pediatrician willingness to prescribe the vaccine,
    acceptable price for the vaccine, and prevalence of infection
 • A polarization of the customer base may exist where a certain segment experiences a higher
    prevalence of infection
 • Division of city or suburban neighborhood does not seem to be relevant

Case 2: EarX (Ear Infection Vaccine)
 Brainstorming
 How could you segment the population to identify a patient group that is more affected by
 ear infections?
 Remind if needed major risk factors described in the prompt are hygiene and child-to-child contact
 Risk Factors
    - Hygiene
         - Awareness
         - Family income and habits
    - Child-to-child contact frequency
         - Difference in childcare options (daycare/school/homecare)
         - Frequency for common activities (swimming/other classes)
         - Family size

 Market Composition
 If childcare is not brought up, interviewer should prompt: What are different forms of childcare
 and how could they affect the prevalence of ear infections? (Brainstorm)
 - Parents, Relatives, Other full-time caregiver
 - Daycare, School
 In the first 3, the child would have less contact with other children, whereas the child would have
 more contact with other children in daycare or school. Show Exibit 2 to confirm the effect on
 infection rates.
 Deeper analysis of the original surveys reveals that the patients in the 3rd and 4th survey all
 went to daycare or school and ¾ of these parents would vaccinate
Yale Graduate Student Consulting Club© !                                                           23
Case 2: EarX (Ear Infection Vaccine)
 Market Size
 Estimate the number of children in daycare or school that would be vaccinated
 Candidate would need to come up with a reasonable % of children that go to daycare or school
 Example structure
 (US pop.) (life expectancy ~80 years) (ear infection ages) (% daycare or school)
 (% would vaccinate)
 (320M people) (1/80 years) (first 5 years) (1/2) (3/4) = 7.5M children vaccinated
 Candidate now has enough information for a profitability evaluation

 Profitability Calculation
 Candidate can use price set in survey of $50 and should ask for the cost of vaccine production ($15
 per vaccine)
 Revenue
 (# children vaccinated) (vaccine price per child)
 (7.5M children) ($50 per child) = 375M
 Cost
 (Upfront) + (# children vaccinated) (EX1 cost + Royalty cost)
 (100M) + (7.5M)($30) = $325M

 Profit
 Year 1 = $50M, $150M per year afterwards

Case 2: EarX (Ear Infection Vaccine)
 Summary / End of Case
 Our client wants to know if they should accept to the terms of the currently negotiated deal.

 Recommendation
 Yes, licensing EX1 would allow for a profit of $50M within the first year (more than the goal of
 breaking even within the first year) and then $150M per year afterwards. By analyzing physician
 surveys, we were able to identify a segment of the population with high infection rates and a higher
 need for EX1.

 Risks
 Physician opinions While some physicians see the value of our vaccine (surveys 3 and 4), other
 physicians clearly do not (survey 1 and 2). Physicians who would not prescribe our vaccine would
 affect our sales. Our estimation for the market penetration in school/daycare could be affected.

 Competitive response Since this is a large potential market, competing vaccines should be
 expected to enter the market when our patent expires.

Case 2: EarX (Ear Infection Vaccine)
 Next Steps
 Marketing:
 Increase marketing and education of physicians about the vaccine The major driver for the sales
 will be physician prescriptions. Informative material about the benefit of our product in school/
 daycare situations as part of marketing will be necessary.

 Direct to consumer marketing Parents who have children with high ear infection rates would value
 this vaccine and this could help if their physicians do not want to prescribe the vaccine.

 Explore other global markets Ear infections should be common outside of the US as well and
 should prove to expand the market size by several magnitudes.

 Examine other opportunities:
 Consider acquiring Ear-X While licensing is the major option analyzed here, a similar analysis could
 be performed on the value of acquiring Ear-X. Benefits include a lower payment in the long run and
 consolidation of the R/D team into our client’s R/D department to better prepare for competitor
 vaccine entry.

Prompt
Our client, NeoFactor, has produced a drug (NFD), which could be used as a preventative treatment for
two neonatal congenital diseases. In early studies, let’s assume this drug has the same efficacy and
potential in both diseases. However, NeoFactor only has enough capital and expertise to initiate a
clinical trial for one disease. Which disease should NeoFactor prioritize?
Additional Information (provided on request)
Disease 1 (D1)
- Improper development causes errors in vision
- Standard of care (most common current treatment, can be thought of as a “competitor”) is surgery to
   repair developmental damage within 72 hours of birth and follow up appointments
Disease 2 (D2)
- Slow development leads to weakness in lungs for the first year
- Standard of care requires 1 year of hospitalization
NeoFactor drug (NFD)
- Early detection of D1 and D2 already occurs for all premature births (earlier than 39 weeks)
- NFD would be given in response to early detection of symptoms to prevent disease progression
Physician and Patient Opinions
- Physicians would prescribe if the cost of NFD would provide a cost savings

 Market Comparison
 Candidate should want to analyze market size differences or identify patient populations
 Provide exhibit 1 and prompt: What can be interpreted from this table?
 Interpretation of Exhibit 1
 1) D1 and D2 occur at different prevalence depending on the time of birth
 2) Actual patient populations can be estimated using this table
 Patients with D1: 10k+10k+16k = 36k
 Patients with D2: 15k+5k+4k = 24k
 D1 has a larger population by 12k

 Market Penetration
 What could potentially make a patient switch from the current standard of care / competitor?
 (Brainstorm)
 Patient Preferences
  -Effectiveness:
     -Efficacy of treatment
     -Physician advice (expert advice)
  -Attractiveness to use:
     -Costs

Case 3: NeoFactor (Growth Factor)
 Market Comparison
 Effectiveness:
 Assume the standard of care and the drug treatments are equally effective.
 Physician’s advice is neutral at this moment.

 Cost:
 The standard of care for:
 D1 – surgery and 2 yearly follow up appointments
 D2 – hospitalization for 6 months

 Interviewee should ask to clarify costs. Cannot give our expected price yet, but:
 D1 - Surgery costs $1900 and follow up appointments are about $500
 D2 - Hospitalization is $1500 per day
 Calculate the cost to the patient for the current standard of care
 D1 = $1.9k + $.5k + $.5k = $2.9k
 D2 ~ $1.5k/day * 360 days/2 = $270K
 D2 has a much more expensive “competitor”.

 Convenience:
 Candidate should identify D2 requires serious hospitalization while D1 only requires appointments.
 A good candidate will conclude NFD would be more popular for D2 treatment given the
 standard of care for D2 is more expensive, and time consuming.

Case 3: NeoFactor (Growth Factor)
 Market Comparison
 Based on the standard of care analysis, our team has predicted that 90% of D2 patients
 would use NF1, whereas 50% of D1 patients would use NFD over the standard of care. What
 is the potential profitability of each drug?
 A good candidate should proactively ask the dose and price information to get revenue and cost.

 Provide Exhibit 2
 Same cost of production, longer dosage for D2

 Profit per patient
 [(price/week – cost/week)] (duration of treatment/week)

Case 3: NeoFactor (Growth Factor)
 Summary / End of Case
 The engagement is over and our client wants an answer. Which disease should be
 prioritized?

 Recommendation / Rationale
 NeoFactor should invest in the clinical trial for D2. Although D1 has 12k more patients, the potential
 costs savings to patients is predicted to cause a 90% adoption of NFD for D2 compared to 50% for
 D1. Final calculations for profits predicts $2k more in profit per patient, which adds up to a
 difference in $50.4M more in total profit per year.


 Risks
 Clinical Trial / FDA approval The results for NFD are still preclinical and as with the development of
 most drugs, there is a high potential risk of failure. Client should gather more information regarding
 the successful rate for D1 and D2.

 Standard of Care Changes In the years needed for clinical trial approval to occur, the comparison to
 existing treatments may be less favorable. This would especially be the case if a competitor enters
 the market.

 Physician / Patient Adoption The low prevalence of these two diseases necessitates informing
 physicians about the potential of a new treatment. Otherwise, patient adoption will be low.

Case 3: NeoFactor (Growth Factor)
 Next Steps
 Commercialization Thus far the focus of NeoFactor has been on the clinical trial process. Given the
 current limited finances, the client should consider different options to bring NFD to market (e.g.
 licensing the drug to a larger company with manufacturing, sales/marketing, and distribution.

 Marketing / Information Informing physicians of this option would be the most effective way to
 increase adoption of this drug over the current standard of care.

Prompt
Our client, LT Neuro, developed a new oral treatment for Multiple Sclerosis (MS), which has passed
phase 2 of clinical trials. Before completing the rest of the clinical trial process, our client wants a
revenue projection for the drug in 2019, when the drug would hit peak sales. Specifically, the CEO
would like to see how soon they could breakeven on phase 3 trial costs.

Additional Information (provided on request)
 Multiple Sclerosis
 - An estimated 400k Americans have this disease, causing the brain and spinal cord slowly
      damaged
 - Symptoms include difficulty of movement, speaking, and senses.
 - Diagnosis rate is at 80% of the estimated MS population. 90% of diagnosed receive treatment.
 MS Treatment Market
 - No full cure, but medication allows for management of symptoms
 - Medication injections are the most common treatment. One oral treatment was introduced 4
      years ago and gained popularity for convenience. Two oral drugs have just entered the market.
 Client Information / Goals
 - Our client has experience with launching drugs, but is concerned about the appearance of two
      competitors and how this will impact sales
 - Our client wants to break even on trial costs (in further detail later)

Case 4: LT Neuro (Multiple Sclerosis)
 Market Analysis
 What is the potential treated patient population? (Target Market Calculation)
 Provide number of people with MS, 400K in 2014.
 Example structure –
 (Patient population) (% diagnosed) (% receive treatment) = 400K x 0.8 x 0.9 =288K

 If asked, the candidate can assume the patient population will track with population growth, but
 should still remain around 300k by 2019.

 A intuitive candidate should recall that client’s product is an oral drug and for share of the market for
 oral vs injectable. Otherwise, as long as the candidate asks for the revenue information on the
 overall market, provide Exhibit 1.
 Interpretations
 - Oral drugs are gaining market share, but there is no information for 2019 (client goal year)

 How many patients will be using oral medication in 2019?
 One example to do the estimation is to assume the trend is expected to continue at a rate of
 15k patients per year. (2014 oral treatment patients) + (rate)(5 years) = 75k + 75k = 150k

 Candidate should recall total target market is about 300k and realize that oral treatments will make
 up 50% of the market in 2019.

Case 4: LT Neuro (Multiple Sclerosis)
 Market Analysis (continued)
 A good candidate would not expect 100% market share capture and would ask what market share
 we expect to capture given the other 3 existing competitors in the oral market.
 What are factors that could affect our client’s market share?
 -Product Comparison
     -Efficacy
     -Price
 -Marketing
     -Patient preference
     -Doctor preference

 Our client’s drug has been demonstrated to be significantly more efficacious than the older
 competitor “Drug 1”, and is similar to Drug 2 and 3 in phase 2 comparisons. This
 information was used to project customer adoption of our drug (Show Exhibit 2)

 Candidate should be able to calculate projected market share

 [(Drug 1) (Share taken) + (Drug 2) (Share taken) + (Drug 3) (Share Taken)] (2019 oral pop.)
 [(40%) (50%) + (30%) (10%) + (30%) (10%)] (150k)
 [20% + 3% + 3%] (150k)
 39k patients are projected to use our drug


Yale Graduate Student Consulting Club© !                                                       39
Case 4: LT Neuro (Multiple Sclerosis)
 Profitability
 With the expected patient population using our drug, how do you calculate profitability?

 Revenue: Typical pricing for MS drugs are $4k/year/patient
 (Price) (Volume) = ($4k) (39k) = 156M

 Costs: What are the potential costs involved proceeding?
 Fixed costs
   -Phase 3 costs (mentioned in prompt)
   -Drug launch costs
   -Investments in expanding company capacity
 Variable costs
   -Manufacturing
   -Sales/Distribution
 After brainstorming, provide the following:
 Phase 3 clinical trials and production changes will cost $80M, 30M, 20M, and 20M for
 2014-2018. Drug launch preparation will cost 50M in 2019. Production/sales/distribution will
 cost 60M/year.

 Total fixed costs= $80M+$30M+$20M+$20M+$50M=$200M.
 From 2019, the annual profit would be 156M-60M=$96M/year.
 Year 1 = (104M) , Year 2 = (8M)
 Candidate should note that breakeven on development costs would occur in roughly over two years
Yale Graduate Student Consulting Club© !                                                      40
Case 4: LT Neuro (Multiple Sclerosis)
 Summary / End of Case
 Should our client proceed with phase 3 clinical trials?

 Recommendation / Rationale

 The client should proceed with phase 3. Launch of LT Neuro’s drug would coincide with an increase
 of oral treatment usage to 50% of the MS treatment population. Additionally, market share analysis
 has estimated that LT Neuro’s drug could capture 26% of the oral treatment market. The revenue
 generated from this market share is $156M/year. Further projection of this revenue shows that the
 drug would breakeven with clinical trial costs slightly over 2 years after launch and bring in 96M in
 profits every year afterwards.

 Risks
 Clinical Trial Failure Phase 3 failure would undermine the current calculations

 Competitive Response Existing injection treatment companies are experiencing a decline in market
 share. They should be expected to also switch to oral treatments, potentially diluting our client’s
 share.

 Newly Emerging Drugs Similar to our client’s projected capture of market share, similarly effective
 or greater efficacy drugs could sway customer preference away from our client’s drug.

Case 4: LT Neuro (Multiple Sclerosis)
 Next Steps
 Maintain Market Awareness: The potential profits from this product are based on capturing
 significant market share, 26% of the oral market or 13% of the total market in 2019. Any changes
 based on pricing adjustments by competitors or the potential entry of new competitors should be
 paid attention to.

 Expand Adoption of LT drug: Since the efficacy of LT1 is greater than the older oral drug (Oral Drug
 1), the client should utilize effective marketing to draw even more market share from this competitor.

 Prompt
 Our client wants to acquire O’Care (OC), a small biotech company. Most of OC’s products are in
 development in the preclinical phase, but OC does have a single revenue stream. This revenue is
 from sales of OC1, the only FDA approved orphan drug to treat Disease X. Disease X is an inherited
 disease that affects 1/20000 among children at the age of 9 and younger. Negotiations with OC have
 led to a price of $60M. The client hires you to access whether they should acquire OC or not.
 Additional Information (provided on request)
 Client Goal (Interviewer should emphasize this)
 - The board will approve the deal only if the acquisition can breakeven in 5 years.
 OC Business Model:
 - OC develops orphan drugs in house, but OC1 is the sole revenue stream. Other preclinical drugs
    can be considered mainly R&D cost within the 5 years.
 - Contracts with a third party for OC1 manufacturing and distribution/sales/marketing.
 Client Business Model:
 - Develops several classes of pharmaceuticals in house, but wants to expand to orphan drugs.
    Manufactures all drugs in house. Same external distribution/sales/marketing channels as OC.

Case 5: O’ Care (Orphan Drug)
 Profit Analysis for OC
 Candidate can start with by comparing the financial structure for OC and our client.

 Provide Exhibit 1: Cost structures once candidate asks about cost/revenue issue.
 What can be interpreted from this?

 The R&D costs are very comparable, but our client’s in house production is a large cost savings
 over OC’s approach. Our client also seems to have lower costs for distribution even though they
 operate through the same third party.


 Synergies
 What are potential synergies for this deal?
 - In house production by our client of OC1.
 - Marketing/distribution/sales via the same channel could be renegotiated to lower costs
 - Streamline administration in management.

 How would you analyze each potential synergy?
 - Direct comparison of production/distribution/administrative costs




Yale Graduate Student Consulting Club© !                                                           46
Case 5: O’ Care (Orphan Drug)
 Synergies
 After investigating further, your team estimates that distribution cost of OC1 could be cut by
 50% and production costs could be reduced 80%. What will be the cost savings and
 resulting net profit on OC1 in dollar amounts?

 Candidate should ask for total sales to calculate dollar amounts. 10M revenue per year


 Profitability Comparison
 Old Profitability                         Updated cost after Synergy
 15%=R/D = $1.5M
 25%=Production = $2.5M                    (1/5) $2.5M= $0.5M cost, $2M to profit
 30%=Distribution = $3M                    (1/2) 3M= $1.5M cost, $1.5M to profit
 30%=Net Profit= $3M

 New Profitability
 R/D = $1.5M
 Production = $0.5M
 Distribution = $1.5M
 Net Profit = $6.5M
 Candidate should remember that the goal is breakeven on $60M in 5 years.
 Over 5 years, this equals $32.5M. Below the $60M

Case 5: O’ Care (Orphan Drug)
 Synergies
 At this point, do you think we should go with the deal?
 No. Even with cost reductions from synergy, the net profit over 5 years will add up to $32.5M,
 $27.5M short of the goal set by the board.

 The candidate may reject the deal at this moment, but explain that the CEO wants to brainstorm
 ways that we can use to make the deal attractive.

 A good suggestion would be to renegotiate the purchase price closer to the $32.5M, but a good
 candidate should notice that the revenue side of the profitability equation has not yet been
 explored.

 If not asked, can prompt the following: You’ve explored the cost side of the profitability
 question, how would you expand the revenue side?

Case 5: O’ Care (Orphan Drug)
 Market Penetrations
 The 2013 revenue for OC is $10M. How many patients are using OC’s treatment?
 Example structure –candidate needs patients’ annual expense for OC1: $40K/patient
 # Patients under OC’s drug= Sales/average price= 10M/40K=0.25K patients.

 What percent of the market has OC1 captured thus far?
 If candidate did not ask, can remind Disease X affects 1/20k in children under 10
 (US population / Life Expectancy) (0 to 9 years) (Incidence of X)
 (320M/80) (10) (1/20k) = 2k

 A market penetration of 0.25/2=12.5% for OC.
 Why is market penetration so low?
 - Marketing – the rarity of the disease could make physician and patient awareness low
 - Financial – difficult to pay $40k per patient
     - Insurance coverage – low coverage would make the cost of the drug difficult to pay
     - Price – even with coverage, the copay may be too high
 - Patient Preferences –
     - Alternative treatments/management drugs
     - Patients may not want treatment if the disease is not too severe

 Team has performed a price sensitivity analysis Exhibit 2
 Candidate should interpret the lowering of prices should allow for a larger capture of market share

 Market Penetrations
 Our client’s CEO want to increase penetration to 40%. The CEO mentions that a total $1M/

Case 5: O’ Care (Orphan Drug)
 Summary / End of Case
 Should our client purchase O Care?

 Recommendation/Rationale
 Yes. O Care can be greatly improved by 1) synergies with our client’s existing operations 2)
 modifying the pricing for this drug to increase penetration. This would allow for annual net profits of
 19.5M, much higher than needed for the board’s approval. This would additionally provide our client
 with an expansion into the orphan drug market.

 Risks
 Acquisition logistics: The client needs to consider how to reorganize O Care to adopt this altered
 operations pipeline from an implementation standpoint. Specific points of concern are corporate
 culture fit, management adjustment, and financing the deal.

 Competitive Response: Although OC1 is the only treatment currently approved, treatment of this
 disease is lucrative so other companies may consider entering this market.

 Regulatory: The length of the patent on OC1 should be considered because this drug has been on
 the market. Expiration of the patent would allow new generic competitors to enter the market at a
 much lower price point.

Case 5: O’ Care (Orphan Drug)
 Next Steps
 Examine Disease X Patient Population: With only 40% market penetration even after cutting the
 price in half, there must be other factors that could be examined that would encourage usage of
 OC1 and thus increase units sold.

 Expansion to International Markets: The analysis for this case mainly focused on a US population,
 but other countries may have similar or even higher prevalence rates. These represent entirely
 unexplored opportunities.

Case 6: Ultimate Bandage
 Market Analysis
 Since the client is asking for a market analysis, candidate should ask about customers.
 (If asked competitors, growth, and size covered in clarifying info)

 Who do you think is the target customer? (Who do you think would use UB?)
 Potential retailers would be a good suggestion, but redirect to end users

 Candidate should come up with customer categories that make sense and then present Exhibit 1.
 Athletes = 300M bandages
 Construction Workers = 600M bandages

 A good candidate would note that these different customer segments may have different needs that
 could be fulfilled with the new product.

 What features do you think athletes and construction workers would value?
 How would you analyze this?
 - Price, healing time, scaring, itchiness, etc.
 - Perform a customer survey (Exhibit 2)
 What can be interpreted from this Exhibit?
 -Athletes rank features offered by the new product (faster healing time, low scarring) as the top 2.
 CW rank price as the number 1 factor and do not seem too interested in faster healing / low
 scarring.

Yale Graduate Student Consulting Club© !                                                                56
Case 6: Ultimate Bandage
 Market Analysis
 Based on this survey, the team has estimated that 50% of athletes and 10% of CW will switch
 to a new product priced at $1.20. How do you think the market would respond to this product
 introduction?

 Internal
    -Customers will switch from our bandage to UB (cannibalization of client’s products)
 External
    -Customers will switch from competitor bandage to UB (market share gain)

 There will be some cannibalization of our product, but also a gain of market share by taking part of
 the competitor’s share.

 If candidate does not come up with this, try reiterating the following information. A percentage of
 customers will switch to this new product. Our client’s market share is currently 60% and
 competitors hold the other 40%. Market share for both should be changed in some way.

 An insightful candidate would realize that depending on which number is larger (market share gain
 or cannibalization) the launch of the product could be more profitable overall or less profitable
 If there are two factors that could change, how do we compare this?
 -Compare profitability between the two scenarios
 -Compare revenue first and then costs

Yale Graduate Student Consulting Club© !                                                               57
Case 6: Ultimate Bandage
 Revenue Analysis
 Based on this survey and a price of $1.20 per bandage, the team has estimated that 80% of
 the total athletes and 10% of the total CW will switch to a new product. Originally, the large
 bandage is priced at $1 per bandage. How much revenue is gained?
 Old Revenue
 (Total bandages) (Client Market Share) ($1 per bandage) = (1B) (60%) = $600M

 New Revenue
 UB sold = [(Athlete bandages)(% switching) + (CW bandages)(%switching)]
 [(300)(80%) + (600)(10%)] = 240M + 60M = 300M
 300M * $1.2 = $360M

 Regular bandage = (Total bandages) – (Customers switching to UB)
 1B - 300M = 700M
 Client Share of regular bandages = 700M (60%) = 420M
 420M * $1 = $420M

 *We assume our client’s share 60% is homogenous in each segment of customer.
 New Revenue = 360M + 420M = $780M
 Client can gain $180M in revenue

 After revenue analysis is complete, candidate should realize that although revenue has
 increased, costs changes have not been factored in.

Case 6: Ultimate Bandage
 Cost Analysis
 What do you think will change with cost if we introduce UB?
 Example:
 Variable Cost
    - Material cost increase (new material)
    - Production cost increase (may need new manufacturing adjustments)
    - Labor cost increase (may require more labor to produce both types of bandages)
 Fixed Cost
    - Investment in material, production or labor changes
 Variable costs for the regular bandage were $2 per box. Variable costs for UB will have to be
 raised to $7 per box. Additionally an investment of $50M will have to be made to reorganize
 the production facilities. No other fixed cost before or after introduction of UB. For each box,
 there’re 10 bandages for both regular and UB.
 Old Costs
 600M *0.2 = 120M
 New Costs
 (UB cost) + (regular bandage cost) + (investment)
 (UB sold)(cost per UB)                                      = (300M)(.7) = $210M
 (Client share of regular bandages)(cost per regular bandage) = (420M)(.2) = $84M
 Investment                                                   =              $50M
 New Variable Costs = $294
 New Total cost = $344

Case 6: Ultimate Bandage
 Profitability Comparison
 Old Profits
 $600M-$120M = 480M

 New Profits
 $780M-$344M = 486M
 Factor in investment
 First year profit = 486M- 50M= 436M

 Minimal increase in profits per year (6M) and factoring in the investment makes this a net
 loss in the first 8 years.

 Break-even time:
 Investment/additional profit= 50M/6M=8.33 years.

Case 6: Ultimate Bandage
 Summary / End of Case
 Our client wants to launch a new product, UB, to capture more revenue and ultimately
 increase profits. Should our client launch the UB?

 Recommendation / Rationale
 I would recommend our client not to launch the product. The product does clearly have the potential
 to draw in a good portion of the total large bandage market (300M or 30%). However, the costs
 associated with this move end up cannibalizing our original profits. In sum, this move results in a
 marginal increase of profit (6M) which is before factoring in the investment of 50M

 (Candidate could argue the other way and say the gains of 10% in revenue would be significant and
 the investment could be eventually paid back, but should be able to rationalize thoroughly)

 Risks
 Opportunity Cost Client would be the first large bandage maker to differentiate the market.

 Competitive Response Other competitors could realize the potential for a differentiated product and
 introduce their own product to take aim at our client’s market share




Yale Graduate Student Consulting Club© !                                                          61
Case 6: Ultimate Bandage
 Next Steps
 Maintain Market Awareness If differentiation does occur in this market, the client should consider
 introducing the UB as a way to counter a loss of market share.

 Lower Costs of UB The new product is over 3 times more costly to make per bandage. Reducing
 this cost would allow for a better profit margin and could make the launch of this product more
 viable. Similar reduction in investment would also make this approach viable.

 Perform Price Sensitivity Analysis For this case the price for UB was fixed at $1.2. If the price could
 be increased enough and still capture enough market share, the profitability calculation of this new
 product would change.

 Explore the opportunity with other sizes Only one size of bandage was analyzed. Other sizes could
 have different customer bases that are more receptive to a new product or have a higher profit
 margin with less material needed.

Case 7: C. Difficile Vaccine
 Market Size
 How do we define the target population?
 Interviewee should consider the potential at risk populations: Children, pregnant women, elderly
 and try to estimate which would be the largest.

 Otherwise prompt Which is the largest?
 Example calculation assuming equal distribution and stable population
 Children 0 to 4 = (US pop) (Life Expectancy) (first 5 years) = (320M)(1/80)(5) = 20M
 Pregnant Women = (US pop) (Births per year) = (320M)(1/80) = 4M
 Elderly = (US pop)(Life Expectancy)(65 to 80) = (320M)(1/80)(15) = 60M

 The elderly are the largest at risk group
 Besides age another risk factor for getting CDAD is person-to-person contact. How would an
 elderly person be in close contact with others that have C. diff infections? (Brainstorm)
 The environments:
 Large family vs small family
 Living at home vs living in elderly care
 Social community vs isolated community
 Urban areas vs country areas

 High hospitalization rate vs low hospitalization rate

 A good candidate should come up with a few of the above

Case 7: C. Difficile Vaccine
 Market Size
 Our team has identified that 10% of elderly live in long term care and are the most affected
 segment. If we assume a peak penetration rate of 75%, how much in minimum should we
 charge per vaccination?

 6M elderly live in long term care.
 (Elderly Pop)(Long term care)(Peak penetration) = (60M)(1/10)(3/4) = 4.5M

 Client goal is a blockbuster drug or 1B in revenue.
 1B / 4.5M = $222 per vaccine

 How do we determine if this a reasonable price?

Case 7: C. Difficile Vaccine
 Pricing
 Instead of asking the patients directly, let’s determine the cost to a patient per year if left
 unvaccinated as a “break even point” for the patient. What is the total cost to patients in
 long term care if not vaccinated?
 Can remind the candidate that the chain of events for CDAD treatment is 1) overgrowth of C. Diff,
 2) hospitalization for testing, and 3) antibiotic treatment. Candidate should ask for the chances of
 each event : 50%, 50%, and 66%
 6M elderly live in long term care.
 Long term care elderly with C. Diff overgrowth = (6M) (50%) = 3M
 Patients who need hospitalization                   = (3M) (50%) = 1.5M
 Patients who need antibiotics                       = (1.2M) (66%) = 0.8M

 Candidate should ask for cost of hospitalization and antibiotics to calculate the cost per
 patient

 Hospitalization = $2k / day, requires 5 days = $10k per treatment
 Antibiotic Treatment                        = $2K per treatment

 Hospitalization total cost = (1.5M)($10k) = $15B
 Antibiotic total cost =      (0.8M)($2k) = $1.6B
 Total cost = $16.6B

 Pricing
 Calculate the cost of c. difficile treatment per long term care elderly patient

 Total cost = $16.6B
 6M elderly patients in long term care

 $16.6B in total cost / 6M elderly patients = $2.77K or almost $3K per person in potential cost

Case 7: C. Difficile Vaccine
 Summary / End of Case
 Our client wants an appropriate pricing scheme for a C. difficile vaccine in development.
 Candidate can decide either way if this pricing is reasonable as long as they can defend their
 answer.

 Recommendation / Rationale
 To reach the prompted goal of a blockbuster product, the client should price the vaccine at $222
 given our estimation of an elderly market size of 6M individuals. The alternative costs of C. difficile
 treatment are near $3000 per year, significantly more than the vaccine price. Thus, we expect that
 our client would find vaccine sales to be positive if they were to target the elderly population.

 Risks
 Patient Finances A $222 vaccine may still be expensive for elderly patients who may not be able to
 afford such a costly preventative measure and renewing vaccination rates were not considered.

 Insurer Finances Medicare would likely cover the cost of C. difficile treatment because of the need
 for hospitalization, but this may not extend to a preventative vaccine. Especially considering the
 vaccine success is actually only 75%, this would mean that there would be additionally associated
 costs to include on top of the basic vaccine price.

 Regulatory As this product is still in development, the approval process of the drug should be
 factored into the decision to continue with this drug.

 Next Steps
 Cost Analysis Although the revenue side of this examination looks favorable, none of the
 production, sales/manufacturing, or distribution costs were not explored in this case. There may
 also be additional development costs since the clinical trial stage was not discussed.

 Incorporate other potential populations The focus of this case was on the long term elderly
 population, but elderly in general and children are at risk for this disease. Investigating other
 potential target segments within these two age groups could expand overall sales.

 Prompt
 Your client is pharmaceutical company developing a product for mild to moderate (not severe)
 inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). IBD is characterized by periods of bowel pain flare ups followed
 by periods of normal bowel function. The two main products the client is considering is a drug and
 an at home diagnostic test. The drug would help reduce symptoms of IBD and the home diagnostic
 test would be used to help patients determine when to take drugs. The client wants your help to
 estimate the size of both markets that they can capture.
 Additional Information (provided on request)
 Inflammatory Bowel Disease
 - Complex disease that has genetic and environmental risk factors.
 Client Information
 - Client has full capabilities to manufacture, market, sell, and distribute both the drug and
     diagnostic test

Case 8: IBD Products
 Market Size Breakdown
 Candidate should start with understanding the patient pool
 How would estimate the Market size for your client in term of IBD population?
 - Segment patients with IBD
     - Severity (mentioned in the prompt)
     - Different disease types (described as umbrella term in the prompt)
     - Populations with higher prevalence
     - Populations that seek treatment

 The major forms of IBD are ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn’s disease (CD). UC is 1 in 1000
 of the population and Crohn’s is 1 in 600. Severity can be broken up in both cases at a ratio
 of 1:2:1 for mild: moderate: severe. 2/3rds of all patients seek treatment

 Calculation
 (US pop) (prevalence) (mild + moderate) (seek treatment)
 UC = (300M) (1/1000) (3/4) (2/3) = 150k
 CD = (300M) (1/600) (3/4) (2/3) = 250k

 Total target population = 400k

Case 8: IBD Products
 IBD Drug
 Launch of our client’s drug would be 1 out of 30 drugs on the market. The current average
 price is $2000 per month and patients take the drugs all year.
 What would be the total revenue generated from this approach?

 Interviewee should check if they can assume 1/30 is the factor to divide the target population.
 Market studies of our drug have demonstrated that because our drug has around average
 efficacy and is entering late, market penetration is expected to be more closer to 1/40.



 Calculation
 Price per year = 24k/year
 (Target population) (Market penetration) (price per year)

 (400k)(1/40) (24k) = 240M/year

 Diagnostic
 Our client is also developing an at home diagnostic tool for IBD. This tool measure the level
 of inflammation in a patients stool. Individuals would still need to be formally diagnosed by
 a doctor by colonoscopy before use. Our client’s tool would help them to track their periods
 of flare up at home. What would be the total revenue that could be generated from this
 product?

 Interviewee should be given the following information when requested:
 Expected penetration is 80%. For the amount patients would need per month, our client
 expects to charge $100.
 Calculation
 (Total Target Market) (Penetration) (Price per month) (months per year)

 (400K) (4/5) ($100) (12) = $384M / year

Case 8: IBD Products
 Cost Comparison
 Given a more favorable comparison in revenue for the diagnostic test, what other factors
 would you need to consider before deciding on one product?

 Competition
 - Competitive response (for a drug, will be difficult to compete in a crowded market. For the
 diagnostic other competitors could enter)

 Cost Comparison
 - Production (different costs for producing a drug vs producing a diagnostic)
 - Sales
 - Marketing (physicians vs direct to patient marketing)
 - Distribution (pharmacy for drug, possibly retail stores for diagnostic)

 Regulatory Barriers
  - FDA approval for the drug
  - Different approval process for a diagnostic (drug would actually need to be consumed or
 introduced into the body)




Yale Graduate Student Consulting Club© !                                                         77
Case 8: IBD Products
 Summary / End of Case
 Our client is interested in IBD interventions and has asked our firm to size the market

 Findings
 The total market size of IBD patients is estimated at 400k

 Recommendation / Rationale
 The diagnostic tool would be the more favorable product to introduce judging by the revenue size.
 Considering a total market size of IBD patients at 400K, introducing a new drug into a crowded
 market would capture a very small fraction (1/40), especially when there are few distinguishing
 features. The diagnostic tool instead provides an opportunity to explore the same large market from
 the consumer side, which would make our client the first in an untapped market.

 (The recommendation here could go either way, although more information supports the diagnostic
 tool.)

 Risks
 Regulation Demonstration that the diagnostic tool would be efficacious is important.

 Competition: Development of similar diagnostics by other players should be expected given the
 large size of the market and the lack of competition compared to the drug market.

Case 8: IBD Products
 Next Steps
 Expedite approval of diagnostic: Given the opportunity to expand into an unexplored market, the
 client should try to be first to market.

 Continuous improvement of the diagnostic The client should expect to see other companies look for
 a way into this home diagnostic market. By improving the tool, our client could build a recognizable
 brand name for the product.

 Consider working with patient advocate groups One way patients share and distribute information is
 through patient groups that share the same affliction. A strong marketing approach would be to
 support and inform these groups of the availability of this tool.

Case 9: Boreal (Hair Care)
 Profitability Analysis
 Since the client has recognized the issue of profitability underperformance, candidate should ask
 for information about the profitability of this division.
 Provide Exhibit 1
 What can be interpreted from Exhibit 1?
 - Hair Care and Hair Styling companies seem to be operating with healthy margins
 - The Hair Solutions (HS) seems to be struggling although the other hair transplant subsidiary
 Fountain of Hair (FoH) is profiting.

 Underperformance of the division could be attributed to HS

 Why is HS underperforming comparing with FoH?
 External (less likely since two subsidiaries are both in hair transplants)
 -Hair Transplant Market
     -Market Share
     -Competition
     -Growth Trends
 Internal (more possible)
 -Low Revenue (Key issue here)
      -Price
      -# of services
 -High Cost

Case 9: Boreal (Hair Care)
 FoH Underperformance
 The CEO of Boreal has set up a meeting with the heads of FoH and HS

 -The head of HS says that her company specializes in high end clients
 -The head of FoH says that his company specializes in low end clients

 -Both say the potential market for hair transplants is about 3500 per year. They also provide
 company information as requested (show Exhibit 2)

 Interpretations of Exhibit 2
 - Candidate should note that while HS is the higher priced company, it has higher sales than FoH
 - Additionally, costs are relatively the same between the two companies.
 - Total sales (2500+800 = 3300) is covered by these two companies (~95% of the target market).
 Why could HS have more customers? (Brainstorm)
 Product Comparison
 - Quality
 - Price as surrogate for quality
 - Brand reputation
 Customers
 - Preference
 - Perception
 How would you test these reasons? Customer survey or otherwise ask the customers (Exhibit 3)


Yale Graduate Student Consulting Club© !                                                       83
Case 9: Boreal (Hair Care)
 Customer Survey
 How would you interpret Exhibit 3?
 - Total customer base skews from the 100k to 200k range and above. Very few customers are
   below 100k
 - Customers of HS and FoH are mostly the same; the majority of customers make over 100k and
   are the same age.
 - More customers using HS because it is perceived as higher quality and majority can afford that
   premium.
 - Majority of budget customers would still pay 10k or more for a transplant

 A good candidate would question if two companies are actually necessary. A single company
 charging 10k would still capture the same number of the customers except for the 5% of FoH
 customers (40 customers).

 Can move to the conclusion of the case.

Case 9: Boreal (Hair Care)
 Summary / End of Case
 The CEO of Boreal has asked for our findings and recommendations

 Recommendation / Rationale
 I recommend that our client merge the two hair transplant companies. This would maintain the
 majority of our customers, and lead to an overall increase in profits as customers switch from the
 low margin ($3k) budget company to the higher margin ($5k) company.

 FoH has been struggling due to a mismatch between company strategy and customer need.
 Although HS and FoH were intended to meet the needs of two customer segments, there is only
 one pool of high end customers who mostly value the perceived quality of HS. A merger would
 better align the hair transplant portion of our client’s business.

 Risks
 Reorganization costs and implementation As with any merger, restructuring of the companies will
 have significant costs associated with implementation.

 Employee layoff issue As the merge happens, potentially, a sizable number of employees will be
 laid off, generating some publicity risks for the conglomerate.

 Loss of greater customer base then estimated A major assumption is that if FoH is closed, the
 majority of customers will switch over to HS. A smaller than expected switch would allow for the
 entry of a budget company.

 Next Steps
 Marketing to convert FoH customer base In the near term HS should try to convert as many of the
 potential FoH customer base (estimated at 800) to using their procedure to increase overall profits

 Explore a low cost budget procedure A significant problem with the operations of FoH was that the
 costs associated with a budget procedure are very similar to the HS procedure. In the long run,
 developing a lower cost procedure with similar or greater margins could be well received by the
 potential FoH customer base and would bolster profitability.

 Glossary of Terms
 Healthcare is a rapidly developing sector of the global economy. This glossary serves as a starting point with a
 collection of terms to make the cases more approachable.

 However, it must be noted that during an actual interview, be cautious with the terms you use unless you fully
 understand them. The YGCC are not experts in this field so the terms contained within this glossary are simplified
 definitions. We highly recommend further research on your part should you decide to engage in this industry.



 Pharmaceuticals – the umbrella term for substances that have a biological effect to manage or treat a disease
 Small molecules – chemically derived pharmaceuticals that are generally much smaller and less complex than
 biologics
 Biopharmaceutical / Biologic – biologically derived pharmaceuticals. Biologics are generally more complex than
 small molecule pharmaceutics. Examples include recombinant insulin (diabetes), interferon (HCV), and antibodies
 (commonly used for specifically targeting cancer).
 Medical Devices – Devices used for a therapeutic use. The most easily recognizable are pacemakers (control
 cardiac rhythms)

 Clinical Trials Process – FDA based approval process that pharmaceuticals must pass through before being
 sold to the general. There are many more caveats to explore so visit the FDA website for detailed information
 1) IND – Investigational New Drug. Before entering the clinical trial process, a company must file an application
 that contains chemical analysis of the pharmaceutical and usually safety tests in animal subjects
 2) Phase I – Generally the first studies in humans to test safety
 3) Phase II – Larger scale trial for safety in a target population and efficacy
 4) Phase III – Larger scale trial to test safety and efficacy
 5) NDA – New Drug Application. Once the clinical trial process is complete, the company files an NDA to ask the
 FDA for approval. If approved, the drug can enter the market

 Glossary of Terms

 CS Med (Medical Device)
 - biopsy – a medical procedure to take a sample of tissue from a patient for testing. In this case, this refers to
    testing a breast mass for the diagnosis of cancer.
 - commercialization – ways to bring a product to market. In this case, the client does not want to consider
    selling the company or the intellectual property so that leaves in house production or some form of partnership


 Ear X (Ear Infection Vaccine)
 - self-resolving – a condition that the body can fix or “resolve” on its own.
 - licensing – an agreement between two organizations where one group will give the other permission to use
    their technology or invention in exchange for a fee (royalty or upfront payment). In this case GP wants to
    license EX1 and carry through the invention to the market.
 - royalties – a payment given to one company from another in payment of the right to use a technology. Usually
    falls under a licensing agreement. In this case, the GP would pay Ear X for the right to use the technology of
    producing an ear infection vaccine


 NeoFactor (Growth Factor)
 - neonatal – newborn babies
 - congenital disease – a disease that develops before, at, or immediately (a few weeks) after birth. In this case,
   D1 and D2
 - premature birth – a birth that occurs earlier than the “normal” 39 weeks
 - standard of care – the current, widely accepted method of treatment for patients with a certain disease

 Glossary of Terms

 LT Neuro (Multiple Sclerosis)
 - multiple sclerosis – a disease that affects the protective covers of nerves in the spinal cord and the brain. This
    damage is what causes the symptoms
 - phase 2 clinical trials - see first page of glossary. In this case, it is mainly important to understand that there is
    still one more phase of the clinical trial to complete which would take several years before LT Neuro could
    enter the market with the new oral drug.
 - drug launch cost – beyond payment of research, development, and clinical trials; companies need to pay



 O’ Care (Orphan Care)
 - preclinical phase – prior to beginning the clinical trial phases. See clinical trial description in the first part of the
    glossary
 - orphan drugs – drugs that affect less than 200,000 patients per year


 Ultimate Bandage
 - cannibalization – a company’s loss of sales of one product by the introduction of a new product. In this case,
     the regular large bandage sales will decrease overall because of the introduction of the UB.

 Glossary of Terms

 C Difficile Vaccine
 - efficacy – the expected ability that a drug can be effective. In this case, the vaccine is expected to prevent
    75% of C diff overgrowth and thus prevent CDAD

 IBD Products
 - Bowel – refers to the intestines and colon
 - IBD – inflammatory bowel disease. An umbrella term for conditions that affect the gastrointestinal tract
    (especially the intestines and colon)
