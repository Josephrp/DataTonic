Certainly, here's the requested information formatted into a markdown table:

| Agent Type | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| Planning/ActionPlanner/SKPrompt | A planner takes a list of functions, a goal, and chooses which function to use. For each function the list includes details about the input parameters. [START OF EXAMPLES] {{ActionPlanner_Excluded.GoodExamples}} {{ActionPlanner_Excluded.EdgeCaseExamples}} [END OF EXAMPLES] [REAL SCENARIO STARTS HERE] - List of functions: {{ActionPlanner_Excluded.ListOfFunctions}} - End list of functions. Goal: {{ $input }} |
| Planning/SequentialPlanner/SKPrompt | Create an XML plan step by step, to satisfy the goal given, with the available functions. [AVAILABLE FUNCTIONS] {{$available_functions}} [END AVAILABLE FUNCTIONS] To create a plan, follow these steps: 0. The plan should be as short as possible. 1. From a <goal> create a <plan> as a series of <functions>. 2. A plan has 'INPUT' available in context variables by default. 3. Before using any function in a plan, check that it is present in the [AVAILABLE FUNCTIONS] list. If it is not, do not use it. 4. Only use functions that are required for the given goal. 5. Append an "END" XML comment at the end of the plan after the final closing </plan> tag. 6. Always output valid XML that can be parsed by an XML parser. 7. If a plan cannot be created with the [AVAILABLE FUNCTIONS], return <plan />. All plans take the form of: <plan> <!-- ... reason for taking step ... --> <function.{FullyQualifiedFunctionName} ... /> <!-- ... reason for taking step ... --> <function.{FullyQualifiedFunctionName} ... /> <!-- ... reason for taking step ... --> <function.{FullyQualifiedFunctionName} ... /> (... etc ...) </plan> <!-- END --> To call a function, follow these steps: 1. A function has one or more named parameters and a single 'output' which are all strings. Parameter values should be xml escaped. 2. To save an 'output' from a <function>, to pass into a future <function>, use <function.{FullyQualifiedFunctionName} ... setContextVariable="<UNIQUE_VARIABLE_KEY>"/> 3. To save an 'output' from a <function>, to return as part of a plan result, use <function.{FullyQualifiedFunctionName} ... appendToResult="RESULT__<UNIQUE_RESULT_KEY>"/> 4. Use a '$' to reference a context variable in a parameter, e.g. when `INPUT='world'` the parameter 'Hello $INPUT' will evaluate to `Hello world`. 5. Functions do not have access to the context variables of other functions. Do not attempt to use context variables as arrays or objects. Instead, use available functions to extract specific elements or properties from context variables. DO NOT DO THIS, THE PARAMETER VALUE IS NOT XML ESCAPED: <function.Name4 input="$SOME_PREVIOUS_OUTPUT" parameter_name="some value with a <!-- 'comment' in it-->"/> DO NOT DO THIS, THE PARAMETER VALUE IS ATTEMPTING TO USE A CONTEXT VARIABLE AS AN ARRAY/OBJECT: <function.CallFunction input="$OTHER_OUTPUT[1]"/> Here is a valid example of how to call a function "_Function_.Name" with a single input and save its output: <function._Function_.Name input="this is my input" setContextVariable="SOME_KEY"/> Here is a valid example of how to call a function "FunctionName2" with a single input and return its output as part of the plan result: <function.FunctionName2 input="Hello $INPUT" appendToResult="RESULT__FINAL_ANSWER"/> Here is a valid example of how to call a function "Name3" with multiple inputs: <function.Name3 input="$SOME_PREVIOUS_OUTPUT" parameter_name="some value with a &lt;!-- &apos;comment&apos; in it--&gt;"/> Begin! <goal>{{$input}}</goal> |
| Planner/StepwisePlanner/SKPrompt | [INSTRUCTION] Answer the following questions as accurately as possible using the provided functions. [AVAILABLE FUNCTIONS] The function definitions below are in the following format: <functionName>: <description> inputs: - <parameterName>: <parameterDescription> - ... {{$function_descriptions}} [END AVAILABLE FUNCTIONS] [USAGE INSTRUCTIONS] To use the functions, specify a JSON blob representing an action. The JSON blob should contain an "action" key with the name of the function to use, and an "action_variables" key with a JSON object of string values to use when calling the function. Do not call functions directly; they must be invoked through an action. The "action_variables" value should always include an "input" key, even if the input value is empty. Additional keys in the "action_variables" value should match the defined [PARAMETERS] of the named "action" in [AVAILABLE FUNCTIONS]. Dictionary values in "action_variables" must be strings and represent the actual values to be passed to the function. Ensure that the $JSON_BLOB contains only a SINGLE action; do NOT return multiple actions. IMPORTANT: Use only the available functions listed in the [AVAILABLE FUNCTIONS] section. Do not attempt to use any other functions that are not specified. Here is an example of a valid $JSON_BLOB: { "action": "functionName", "action_variables": {"parameterName": "some value", ...} } [END USAGE INSTRUCTIONS] [END INSTRUCTION] [THOUGHT PROCESS] [QUESTION] the input question I must answer [THOUGHT] To solve this problem, I should carefully analyze the given question and identify the necessary steps.
