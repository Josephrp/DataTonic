There is no definitive answer, as the meaning of life is unique to each individual. However, some common themes that emerge when people discuss the meaning of life include:\n","> \n","> * **Finding purpose and fulfillment:** Many people find meaning in life by pursuing their passions and interests. This could involve anything from creative pursuits like art or music, to helping others through volunteering or charity work.\n","> * **Connecting with others:** Strong social connections are essential for human well-being. Having close relationships with family, friends, or a romantic partner can give life meaning and purpose.\n","> * **Making a difference:** Many people find meaning in life by making a positive impact on the world. This could involve working to solve social or environmental problems, or simply helping others in need.\n","> * **Seeking knowledge and understanding:** Some people find meaning in life by pursuing knowledge and understanding. This could involve studying a particular subject, exploring different cultures, or simply learning new things for the joy of learning.\n","> * **Experiencing beauty and wonder:** The world is full of beauty and wonder, from the natural world to the creations of human culture. Many people find meaning in life by appreciating and experiencing these things.\n","> \n","> Ultimately, the meaning of life is a personal journey that each individual must discover for themselves. There is no right or wrong answer, and what is meaningful to one person may not be meaningful to another. The important thing is to find what gives you a sense of purpose, fulfillment, and joy.\n","> \n","> Here are some additional thoughts on the meaning of life from some of history's most famous thinkers:\n","> \n","> * **Aristotle:** \"The only true wisdom is in knowing you know nothing.\"\n","> * **Buddha:** \"No one saves us but ourselves. No one can and no one may. We ourselves must walk the path.\"\n","> * **Confucius:** \"Choose a job you love, and you will never have to work a day in your life.\"\n","> * **Lao Tzu:** \"The journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.\"\n","> * **Marcus Aurelius:** \"The happiness of your life depends upon the quality of your thoughts.\"\n","> * **Viktor Frankl:** \"Man's search for meaning is the primary motivation in his life.\"\n","> * **Dalai Lama:** \"The purpose of our lives is to be happy.\""],"text/plain":["<IPython.core.display.Markdown object>"]},"execution_count":6,"metadata":{},"output_type":"execute_result"}],"source":["to_markdown(response.text)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"149ae1d7-4039-46ba-82db-909ddfd56b30","metadata":{"id":"149ae1d7-4039-46ba-82db-909ddfd56b30"},"source":["RAG(Lanchain+chroma+GeminiAI)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"13760d8e-86f6-4fc5-85e2-0eb3ba65025c","metadata":{"id":"13760d8e-86f6-4fc5-85e2-0eb3ba65025c"},"outputs":[],"source":["from langchain_google_genai import ChatGoogleGenerativeAI\n","from langchain_google_genai import GoogleGenerativeAIEmbeddings"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"bc410479-26a8-494a-b244-7619714cfa05","metadata":{"id":"bc410479-26a8-494a-b244-7619714cfa05"},"outputs":[],"source":["from langchain.document_loaders import TextLoader\n","from langchain.vectorstores import Chroma\n","from langchain.text_splitter import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter\n","from langchain.chains import RetrievalQA\n","from langchain.document_loaders import TextLoader\n","from langchain.document_loaders import DirectoryLoader\n","from langchain_google_genai import ChatGoogleGenerativeAI\n","from langchain_google_genai import GoogleGenerativeAIEmbeddings\n","from langchain.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate\n","from langchain.schema.output_parser import StrOutputParser"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"d3a9526d-8321-4683-b71e-2684cd15437f","metadata":{"id":"d3a9526d-8321-4683-b71e-2684cd15437f"},"outputs":[],"source":["loader = DirectoryLoader('./new_articles/', glob=\"./*.txt\", loader_cls=TextLoader)\n","\n","documents = loader.load()"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"3d565bdb-80fa-472f-aa90-14fbf02e83c6","metadata":{"id":"3d565bdb-80fa-472f-aa90-14fbf02e83c6"},"outputs":[],"source":["text_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=200)\n","texts = text_splitter.split_documents(documents)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"bd53ed72-9b59-4457-a041-71a77dde870b","metadata":{"id":"bd53ed72-9b59-4457-a041-71a77dde870b"},"outputs":[],"source":["model = ChatGoogleGenerativeAI(model=\"gemini-pro\",\n","                             temperature=0.7)\n","embeddings = GoogleGenerativeAIEmbeddings(model=\"models/embedding-001\")"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"95933ee6-7217-4fa4-ad28-1c838ce2d942","metadata":{"id":"95933ee6-7217-4fa4-ad28-1c838ce2d942"},"outputs":[],"source":["vectordb = Chroma.from_documents(documents=texts,\n","                                 embedding=embeddings)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"429c93fe-4be4-4401-be74-8fc2efc0245f","metadata":{"id":"429c93fe-4be4-4401-be74-8fc2efc0245f"},"outputs":[],"source":["# from chromadb.utils import embedding_functions"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"7d2bcde0-ccb5-4025-9473-3489ada838b1","metadata":{"id":"7d2bcde0-ccb5-4025-9473-3489ada838b1","outputId":"e6d41f23-b62a-47bb-f3ea-dd89b1f21af9"},"outputs":[{"data":{"text/plain":["VectorStoreRetriever(tags=['Chroma', 'GoogleGenerativeAIEmbeddings'], vectorstore=<langchain_community.vectorstores.chroma.Chroma object at 0x7f3152e25f60>)"]},"execution_count":61,"metadata":{},"output_type":"execute_result"}],"source":["retriever = vectordb.as_retriever()"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"0d688b89-93fa-4f0d-b686-d469b32083f5","metadata":{"id":"0d688b89-93fa-4f0d-b686-d469b32083f5"},"outputs":[],"source":["qa_chain = RetrievalQA.from_chain_type(model,\n","                                  chain_type=\"stuff\",\n","                                  retriever=retriever,\n","                                  return_source_documents=True)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"435259f3-5c01-46fb-861c-d0f6887de05e","metadata":{"id":"435259f3-5c01-46fb-861c-d0f6887de05e","outputId":"1bb73f0a-6de2-4014-ebd8-343e0f33c60b"},"outputs":[{"data":{"text/plain":["[Document(page_content='Get your TechCrunch fix IRL.
